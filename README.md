- SwiftLint
- SwiftFormat

- Name ✅
- Symbol ✅
- Price ✅

# The app has been tested on following devicws:

The MAX chart sometimes doesnt work correctly, probably this is an error on API side.
In some cases the MAX supply value may display as an infinity symbol(also on the website).



---------------------P.S.---------------------

I will attach a link to the repository with the initial commits and branches and then attach a screenshot of the commits from Source Tree. 
Just a few hours ago, i was cleaning up repositories on Git and accidentally deleted the wrong repository. I confirmed the deletion through my phone and the project was gone.

It would be best to add SwiftFormat and SwiftLint at the  beginning of the project setup, but since I have a very strange mac where everything works quite strange, I couldn't do it initially because nothing was setting up properly and it was throwing errors. 
 I used Xcode for commits(I did it before), but I had to recreate the repositories about 5 times because everything broke during any commits. After that I switched to SourceTree which turned out to be much easier than i thought before.
