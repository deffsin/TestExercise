# Test exercise app

❗️ READ EVERYTHING BEFORE LOOKING AT THE CODE ❗️

# Project description
An app for tracking cryptocurrencies using CoinGecko API. It includes 2 screens: a cryptocurrency listing and details of a specific cryptocurrency with various data.

# Requirements
- SwiftUI
- Combine
- CoinGecko API
- SwiftLint
- SwiftFormat

# General requirements
- CoinGecko API ✅
- REST requests ✅
- Caching(if possible) ✅
- SwiftLint, SwiftFormat ✅
- SwiftUI ✅

# Listing/Market
- Icon ✅
- Name ✅
- Symbol ✅
- Price ✅
- Price change 1h/24h/7 days in percentage ✅
- 24h Volume ✅
- Market cap ✅
- Price chart for the last 7 days ✅

# Detail
- Icon ✅
- Name ✅
- Symbol ✅
- Price ✅
- 24h price change in percentage ✅
- Market cap ✅
- 24h Volume ✅
- Circulating supply ✅
- Total supply ✅
- Max supply ✅

# The app has been tested on following devicws:
- iPhone 14 Pro
- iPhone 14 Pro Max
- iPhone 15 Pro
- iPhone 15 Pro Max
- iPhone SE(3rd gen)

The MAX chart sometimes doesnt work correctly, probably this is an error on API side.
In some cases the MAX supply value may display as an infinity symbol(also on the website).

I will attach a link to the repository with the initial commits and branches and then attach a screenshot of the commits from Source Tree. 
Just a few hours ago, i was cleaning up repositories on Git and accidentally deleted the wrong repository. I confirmed the deletion through my phone and the project was gone.

Make sure that ypu're using the light theme! ⚡️⚡️⚡️⚡️⚡️⚡️

There are no memory leaks. I didn’t write UNIT tests because they were not mentioned in the requirements. I just added more than needed and then removed almost everything except filtering.
It would be best to add SwiftFormat and SwiftLint at the  beginning of the project setup, but since I have a very strange mac where everything works quite strange, I couldn't do it initially because nothing was setting up properly and it was throwing errors. 
 I used Xcode for commits(I did it before), but I had to recreate the repositories about 5 times because everything broke during any commits. After that I switched to SourceTree which turned out to be much easier than i thought before.
